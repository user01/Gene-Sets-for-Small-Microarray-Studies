# Neuroimmunology Capstone

## Part I

Part I of the project consists of classifying cellular samples into Cell Type and General Cell Types.

The pipeline operates by:

1. Pre-processing raw data
2. Dimensional Reduction of data (from 20k features to <10)
3. Classification of data (clustering or other methods)
4. Performance Analysis

The pipeline is controlled by `main.js`. Install proper make dependencies with `npm install` and run the process with `npm start` or `node main.js`.

Add components to the pipeline by amending the start of `main.js` and adding the appropriate script.
